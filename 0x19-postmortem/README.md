Postmortem: The Great Nginx Banana Incident üçå
Issue Summary
Duration: A wild 2-hour rollercoaster ride (from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, UTC-7).
Impact: Picture this: the web service went poof! Users were left hanging, waiting for pages to load like they were stuck in a slow-motion Matrix scene. Approximately 30% of our beloved users were affected.
Root Cause: Brace yourselves‚ÄîNginx, our trusty web server, decided to play hide-and-seek with the backend service. Spoiler alert: it lost.
Timeline
10:00 AM: Our monitoring system, the diligent watchdog, barked an alert. Something was amiss!
10:05 AM: We donned our digital detective hats. Initial hunch: the backend service had a meltdown. Sherlock vibes, anyone?
10:30 AM: Followed misleading breadcrumbs. Turns out, the backend was innocent. Oopsie!
11:00 AM: Emergency flare! DevOps team assembled. We needed Gandalf-level magic.
11:30 AM: Eureka moment: Nginx was moonwalking with a misconfigured proxy_pass. No wonder requests vanished into thin air!
12:00 PM: Victory dance! We tweaked the Nginx config, and voil√†‚Äîthe web service resurrected like a caffeinated zombie.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: Our Nginx server was channeling its inner rebel. The proxy_pass setting was like a GPS sending users to Narnia instead of the backend.
Resolution: We whipped Nginx into shape, updated the config, and pointed it to the right destination. No more interdimensional detours!
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Nginx Config Reviews: Regular checkups to prevent config chaos.
Automated Sanity Tests: Nginx configs need their own sanity checks. We‚Äôre talking ‚ÄúAre you bananas?‚Äù level.
Misconfig Detection Radar: Better monitoring to catch Nginx doing the cha-cha with settings.
Tasks:
Patch Nginx Server: Fix that proxy_pass (TODO: add a dash of common sense).
Memory Monitoring: Because even servers need a mental health check (TODO: set up a memory therapist).
